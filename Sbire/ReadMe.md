## Sbire
![](Workfiles/Render.jpg)

	Play as a Sbire (French word for Minion) for Dust&Ashes, extracted from my work on the custom map Hive Underground.

*The Queen has some "sbires", as she likes to call them, laying around Shine City ready to catch any useful informations.*

## Known Issues
	• Silhouette texture isn't accurate
	• Sbire Portrait missing, it's DNA portrait instead
		
## How to Install
• Make a backup of **Steam\steamapps\common\LLBlaze\Bundles\characters** bundle files
